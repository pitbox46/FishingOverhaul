# FishingOverhaul

Adds a minigame for fishing

## Description

When you pull a fish, a minigame will appear - a fish swimming around a circle. 
Right-click when the fish is inside the catch region to get your loot. 
If you catch the fish inside the crit region, you'll get double loot!

Certain properties can be changed per-fish using the `fishing_index.json`. 
See the guide for more information.
